# Project Description

This project demonstrates version control using GitHub as we utilize the repository to track all changes, commit as a way to record specific changes, branching to isolate work and to evade the main code, merging to combine branches to another, pull requests to merge a feature into main, merge conflicts such as multiple branches wishing to alter the same branch, and collabortation with my peers.

Three branches:
(default) main contains the print statetment of "Hello, World!".
feature-1 also executes a "Hello" print statement, but requires user input.
feature-2 also executes a "Hello" print statement. This will play a role in our merge conflict.

There is a merge conflict when Git sees that two branches want to change the same file.

First pull request to merge feature-1 to main will be from a classmate.
Second pull request to merge featire-2 to main will be from me.
GitHub will highlight the conflict.
Conflict can be manually resolved in the repository.
