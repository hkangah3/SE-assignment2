# SE-assignment2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Within this project, main branch contains the print statetment of "Hello, World!".
feature-1 also executes a "Hello" print statement, but requires user input.
feature-2 also executes a "Hello" print statement. This will play a role in our merge conflict.

There is a merge conflict when Git sees that two branches want to change the same file.

First pull request to merge feature-1 to main will be from a classmate.
Second pull request to merge featire-2 to main will be from me.
GitHub will highlight the conflict.
Conflict can be manually resolved in the repository.
